# 🧠 RNN-Based NLP Projects

Welcome to the **RNN-Based NLP Projects** repository! This repo features Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models built from scratch using PyTorch, with a primary focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as language modeling and sequence prediction.

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository currently includes two projects (more coming soon!):

### 1. **Language Modeling using LSTM**

A character-level language model that learns to predict the next word in a sentence, trained on a dataset extracted from a real-world FAQ document.

- 🔁 Uses **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) cells.
- 🔤 Custom **vocabulary builder** from scratch.
- 📄 Trained on an actual **course Q&A document** (around 1000+ tokens).
- ⚙️ Trains to predict the next word given a sequence.
- 💡 Implemented **from scratch using PyTorch**, including dataset handling and batching.
